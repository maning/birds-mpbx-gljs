This guide is a step-by-step guide for creating a fully interactive map using Mapbox GL JS.
We will use IUCN's List of Endangered Birds in the Philippines from 
[Birdlife's Red Data Book](https://web.archive.org/web/20060202013628/http://www.rdb.or.id/) (2005)
to show sightings threatened birds throughout the country.
